				Hey there! Don’t be upset about being guildless! Let’s see if we can
				sort this little problem out….{' '}
			</h5>
			<h3>Guildmasters</h3>
			<p>
				First things first, are you the guild master? If so go ahead and create
				a guild from the menu on the left hand side. Once you have created a
				guild the application will log you out, sign back in and hey presto, you
				are head honcho of your new raiding guild with full admin rights and
				dashboard access, with the ability to add officers to create and deal
				with raids.
			</p>
			<h3>Members and officers</h3>
			<p>
				So you aren’t a guildmaster? No worries you don’t need that drama
				anyway…. Let me tell you! Firstly make sure your guildmaster has set up
				your guild in the application. If they have fantastic, we are good to
				go. If they go to the admin panel they will be able to add you into the
				guild, I suggest logging out and logging back in. Once you are member of
				the guild you then should be able to see your guilds raids and rosters
				etc. Take a look around and get ready for some awesome raiding!
