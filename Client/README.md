# `WoW Rosters a World of Warcraft Raid creation tool`

This project was created by Jamie Tardi.

## `Getting Started`

### Guild Masters

If you are guild master and you are new please go to sign up > create an account > open the side menu > create a guild. Once you have done this follow the on screen steps to creating your guild.

### Guild Members and officers

If you are a member or an officer of a guild please wait for your guild master (or raid leader) to create the guild. They will be assigned the rank of guild master and be able to add you into the guild, if you are a officer the guild master can also promote you to officer, they will require the email address you registered with.

## `Account Creation`

All members and officers will need to create an account. For ease of use there is a option to sign in with google or create a custom account.

## `Raid Creation`

Only users with the correct privileges can create raids, this is the guild master and any officers that they have promoted. The guild master or officer can create a raid by logging in > open menu > create raid. Anything that is created in the raid can be edited or deleted at a later date so do not worry if this is not finalised.

## `Roster Creation and Assignments `

Only users with the correct privileges can create rosters, this is the guild master and any officers that they have promoted. The guild master or officer can create a roster by logging in > open menu > create roster. Anything that is created in the raid can be edited or deleted at a later date so do not worry if this is not finalised

### Viewing rosters and assignments

Any member of the guild can view rosters and assignments, only officers and guild masters can edit them.

## `Guild Dashboard`

This is useable by anyone of any rank. However only officers and guild masters can use the more advanced features.

# `Contributors`

I am happy to have anyone contribute to this project, even if you would like to refactor and test the code please make a note of what is required below.

## `Running the Project`

<br>

### Front End

You will need to have node installed to run the project. The front end is running on Create-react-app, this means that to install the front end please for the repo and then use cd client > npm install to install the dependencies. The UI is mainly built on material UI.

### Back End

The back end is built on node and express, once forked you will need to enter cd server > npm install to install all of the dependencies including express which is a requirement.. The live project will have the ImageURL constant in the front end directed to the live server and the API end point will be on the live server also. These will need to be changed. The database which is MongoDB requires your own database to access, the project is using ENV files to hide the database String. The image hosting is from AWS please do not change this.

## `Pull Requests`

To contribute you will need to make a pull request on GitHub. I will review pull requests and once I am happy with changes they will be accepted. Please do not be offended if it is not approved, I am happy to provide feedback.
